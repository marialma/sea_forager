# sea_forager
when is a good time to sea forage?

This is a function that takes a look at the http://tide-forecast.com and sunset/sunrise times to help you find a good time to go forage. 

Usage: 

`find_tide()`
* `location` the default is "Monterey-Monterey-Harbor-California". 
    *  This needs to be formatted the same way that tide-forecast.com does it. To get the right format, navigate to the page you want on the site & copy between "locations" and "tides" (eg, for https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Monterey-Monterey-Harbor-California/tides/latest, `Monterey-Monterey-Harbor-California`


`list_locations()`
* lists out location names for California, for convenience.
